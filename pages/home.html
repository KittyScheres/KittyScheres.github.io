                        Hi, my name is <b>Kitty Scheres</b>.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        I am a generalist games programmer with an interest in virtual reality games. 
                        I have <b>8 years of programming experience</b>, of which <b>4 are game-related</b>. During my education at Breda 
                        University of Applied Sciences, I have worked on a couple solo and team-based projects.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        According to team members I have worked with in the past, I am <b>enjoyable to work with</b>. I am <b>eager to share my 
                        knowledge</b> on a subject when this is relevant, I work to <b>create a positive environment</b> for me and my team members, 
                        and I provide insightful feedback.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        While I enjoy working on all kinds of projects, I would like to work on more <b>virtual reality projects</b> as I am 
                        passionate about the technology and think that it has a lot of potential as a tool for entertainment.
                    </span>
