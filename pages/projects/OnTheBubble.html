           On the Bubble is the project I worked on for most of my third year at Breda University of Applied Sciences. It is a <b>custom engine project</b> made 
           for a Super Monkey Ball inspired game. The main selling points for this project are path-traced graphics and a <b>custom level editor</b> used for 
           creating and share custom levels. While working on this project, I took on the role of <b>generalist programmer</b>. My focus was on supporting the 
           creation of the level editor and the implementation of <b>mod.io</b> for the project. I worked on this project with <b>13 other developers</b>. 
           This game and engine were made with a combination of <b>C++</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>HTML</b>.

        <h2>Mod.io</h2>
        <p>
           This project makes use of the <b>Mod.io SDK</b> for the sharing and downloading of user created levels. The player can create a custom level in with 
           the build in level editor and upload it to the Mod.io servers. After that, this level can be found through the level browser. If the player wants to 
           play a custom level, they only need to select the level, and the downloading process gets taken care of during the loading time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was fully responsible for the Mod.io implementation in On the Bubble. The game contains most of the standard features provided by and required 
            from Mod.io. the game supports the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Mod.io login through Steam
            </li>
            <li>
                Level uploading

        <h2>UI implementation</h2>
        <p>
           The UI for On the Bubble is implemented with the help of the Ultralight library. This library allows us to create UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
           Because of my previous experience in web development with these languages, I helped set up some of the UI in the game to keep it responsive. 
           I worked on the following UI:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Intro splash screen
            </li>
            <li>
                Player HUD 
            </li>
        </ul>
