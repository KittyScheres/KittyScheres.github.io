            Wall Town Wonders is a <b>mixed reality</b> town building game where the player must gather resources by playing various minigames. These resources 
            are then used to build the town.

            I worked on this game during my <b>40-week graduation internship</b> at <b><a href="https://www.cyborn.be/" target="_blank">Cyborn</a></b>. 
            During my internship I worked on getting the game ready for release, implementing 2 content updates, and aided in the porting the game from

        <h2>Minigames</h2>
        <p>
            A big part of Wall Town Wonders is its minigames. These minigames are the main method of gaining resources for the player and there are a lot of 
            them. The minigames listed below are a couple of the minigames I worked on:
        </p>

        <!-- Sub heading -->
        <div id="fertilizer">
            <h3>Fertilizer bouncing</h3>
            <p>
                The fertilizer bouncing minigame requires the player to bounce 3 balls of fertilizer to their farm by using their hands or controllers. For 
                this minigame, I made the bouncy ball actor and the gameplay implementation of bouncing it to the farm. My work on the bouncy ball of 
                fertilizer also includes the squishing of the ball when it is hit by the player.
            </p>

        <!-- Sub heading -->
        <div id="painter">
            <h3>Butterfly painter</h3>
            <p>
                The butterfly painter minigame requires the player to paint a group of butterflies to the correct colour by hitting them. The player can 
                select the colour they want to use with the paint selectors in front of the park building.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this minigame, I implemented the base gameplay loop. I implemented functionality for painting the butterflies, checking for the completion 
                condition, paint colour selection, and the paint colour selection actor.
            </p>

        <!-- Sub heading -->
        <div id="lostPackages">
            <h3>Lost packages</h3>
            <p>
                The lost packages minigame requires the player to find a platform with lose crates near it. After finding the platform, the player must move 
                all the crates onto the platform before they get stolen by the ninja.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made all the minigame specific functionality for this minigame. This includes: the spawning of the packages and platform, the ninja stealing 
                packages, keeping track of whether a package is on the floor or on the platform, and detecting when the minigame is over. I also continued to 
                work on this minigame during the polishing process until it was considered finished.
            </p>

        <!-- Sub heading -->
        <div id="giftDelivery">
            <h3>Gift delivery</h3>
            <p>
                The gift delivery minigame is one of the minigames made specifically for the Wall Town Wonders Holiday update. This minigame lets the player 
                take control of a flying chariot which is being pulled forward by butterflies. In from this chariot, the mayor can throw gifts to the people 
                of the wall town. The player’s goal is to throw the correct number of gifts to the town’s people standing on the balloon anchoring platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked on this minigame from start to finish. The movement from the butterfly chariot is the same as the plane’s movement functionality. 
                However, this functionality has been changed to better fit the chariot. The functionality for the town’s people receiving gifts, throwing of 
                gifts, and restocking of gifts has been implemented by me. This includes the <b>animation blueprints</b> for both the mayor in the chariot and the 
                town’s people waiting to receive their packages.
            </p>

    <div id="balloonAnimations">
        <h2>Balloon passenger animations</h2>
        <p>
            When the player has any interactions with the balloon outside of the first balloon related quest. The characters in the balloon react when the 
            player hits the balloon. This reaction is different based on which direction the player hits the balloon from and how hard they hit it. When the 
            player hits the balloon enough times with a lot of force, the characters in the balloon will end up barfing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I implemented the animation blueprint that is applied to the passengers of the balloon.

    <div id="dates">
        <h2>Dates</h2>
        <p>
            The main feature that was added during the valentine’s day update for Wall Town Wonders are the dates. The player can select one of 3 possible 
            dates. When a date is selected, the player choses both the characters that will participate in the date and the modification for the date. When 
            the player confirms the details for the date, the date plays out before them. In most cases this means that the character will go through a set of 
            animations related to the date score that has been calculated for the specific date setup. At the end of the date the characters discuss the result 
            of the date and eventually they might even start a relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
            I setup and maintained most of the dating mechanic during the development of the valentine’s update. I setup the base functionality for all the 
            dates (character and modification selection, calculating the date score, playing the correct set of animations, playing the ending sequence) I also 
            implemented the initial functionality for keeping track of all relationships in the town, finally I also implemented and validated the 
            functionality for all three of the dates currently in Wall Town Wonders (balloon, bathhouse, painting).

            Next to the mixed realty version of Wall Town Wonders, there is also a full virtual reality version. This is a complete version of the mixed reality 
            version of the game with the inclusion of 3 environments to replace the mixed reality rooms. Next to the environments there are also some qualities 
            of life features exclusive to the VR version with the inclusion of a movable player character and a seated mode. This version of the game is 
            available on both <b>PlayStation</b> and <b>Steam</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My contributions to this port are focused on fixing bugs that occurred during the porting process from mixed reality to virtual reality.

        <h2>Pico port</h2>
        <p>
            After developing Wall Town Wonders for the Meta Quest 3, a port for the Pico mixed reality headsets was also made. This is a full port of 
            Wall Town Wonders with all the functionalities present in the Meta Quest version of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like with the VR port, my contributions to the Pico port for Wall Town Wonders revolve around fixing issues that pop-ed up while porting 
            the game from the Meta SDK to the Pico SDK. The bug fixing for this port however, required me to do a lot of work on the <b>mixed reality 
            room management</b>. This also required me to get more familiar with the <b>Pico sense pack SDK</b>.
